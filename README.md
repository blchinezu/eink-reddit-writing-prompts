# reddit-writing-prompts
A web page that reads /r/WritingPrompts and shows it in a readable format for eInk devices.

#### Available @ [writingprompts.duckdns.org](http://writingprompts.duckdns.org/)

#### How it works

 - Get the required reddit page
 - Strip it of a few useless parts
 - Replace all the links so that they'll be passed through our custom parser if clicked
 - Show the page with our custom CSS

#### Privacy

You won't be able to login, comment and such things so you shouldn't worry about privacy stuff. This is made purely for reading purpose.

#### Note

This will work with other subreddits too but there will probably be glitches. That's because I've made it primarly for /r/WritingPrompts. It shouldn't be difficult to adapt it for other subreddits though. Most of the changes would be in the CSS file.
