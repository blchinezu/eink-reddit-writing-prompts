# reddit-for-eink
A web page that reads reddit.com and shows it in a readable format for eInk devices.

This was initially created for /r/WritingPrompts and later updated to support more reddit :)

#### Available @ [reink.duckdns.org](http://reink.duckdns.org/)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### How it works

 - Get the required reddit page
 - Strip it of a few useless parts
 - Replace all the links so that they'll be passed through the custom parser if clicked
 - Show the page with custom CSS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Privacy

You won't be able to login, comment and such things so you shouldn't worry about privacy stuff. This is made purely for reading purpose.
